# CU Internship PDF Scan using OCR

## Inspiration
Managing internship forms manually is time-consuming. Automating data extraction can save effort and reduce errors.

## What it does
It allows CU students to upload internship forms, extracts key details using OCR, and saves them in an Excel file.

## How I built it
- Used **PDF processing** to convert documents into images.
- Applied **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for text extraction.
- Processed and **mapped extracted data** into an Excel file.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structuring the frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** for client-side interactions.
- **Node.js & Express.js** for backend processing.
- **API integration** for efficient data handling and communication.

## Challenges I ran into
- Handling different PDF formats and layouts.
- Improving OCR accuracy for better text recognition.
- Ensuring correct data mapping to structured fields.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Successfully automated form scanning and data extraction.
- Improved OCR accuracy through image preprocessing techniques.
- Built an efficient and scalable pipeline for document processing.

## What I learned
- OCR implementation using **Tesseract** and other libraries.
- Techniques for **PDF to image conversion** and **grayscale preprocessing**.
- Optimizing **data extraction** and formatting results for structured storage.

## What's next for CU Internship PDF Scan using OCR
- Enhancing OCR accuracy with AI-based text recognition.
- Adding a **data validation layer** to improve reliability.
- Integrating with CU's internship portal for seamless automation.
